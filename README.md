This repo contains Myo scripts that can be added to the Myo Script Manager.

* presentations.lua
This script adds on to the basic presentation functionality offered by the built in presentation script Thalmic provides. I used their example code and added modifications.
How to use:
scroll down : wave-right
scroll up   : wave-left
Vary scroll speed: wave + move arm in direction you are waving
